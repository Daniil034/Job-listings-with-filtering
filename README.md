## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Stitches](https://stitches.dev/) - CSS-in-JS library with near-zero runtime 

### What I learned

I learned basics of Stitches and how it can improve my experience of styling React components, though at first it was a pain in a ... to settle it in this project.
I was also able to implement React hook createContext which is quite handy for such small projects over Redux.

### Continued development

I think I will continue poring over this Stitches library and hope to improve my knowledge to decent level.

### Useful resources

- [Vite Static Asset Handling](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html) - This helped me to settle the issue of handling relative paths.
